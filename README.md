# JavaScript-Code-Quiz

## Description

I was given the task to create a Javascript fundamental quiz to gauge the progress of coding students. The app needs to include a timer, mulitple choice questions and the ability to record and store high scores. The app uses HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a clean, easy to use interface.

The user can now start the quiz with 60 seconds to answer 5 mulitple choice questions. Any time the answer chooses the correct answer it moves on to the next question. If the user answers incorrectly, they are notified it is wrong and there is a penalty of 5 seconds off the timer. At the end of the quiz, the user can record their score and view all other scores that are recorded in the local storage. The user also has the option to clear all the scores.

Though I sucuessfully completed the assesment I found it extremely challenging and got assistance for every part of the challenege. I believe the most difficult part for me to execute was the high scores, stopping the timer and using that as a score for the user. I found my way around this by creating a new variable that would assess the time (hold interval) that still remains, if any, and make a new element that displays the time remaining (text content). I also think I could have given more attention to the responsive part of the app because I it's not changing the display when I load it on a smaller screen or device.
